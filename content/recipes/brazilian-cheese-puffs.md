## Ingredients

- 1½ cups shredded mozzarella
- 2 tbs cream cheese
- ¾ cup fine almond flour
- ½ cup grated Parmesan
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 1 egg, beaten
- ½ cup crumbled queso fresco

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400F.
1. Make the dough by melting the shredded mozzarella and cream cheese together in the microwave for 1 minute.
1. Stir in the almond flour, Parmesan, and baking powder.
1. Next, add a beaten egg. Knead the dough until as smooth as possible.
1. Add in the crumbled queso fresco. It won't blend in, so just try to make sure that it is evenly distributed. Divide the mixture into sixteen golf-ball 1. sized balls and place them on a baking sheet lined with a silicone mat.
1. Bake until they start to turn golden brown on top, about seven or eight minutes. Let cool for five minutes before serving.
