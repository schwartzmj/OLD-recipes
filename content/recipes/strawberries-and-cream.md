## Ingredients

- Fresh strawberries - 1 ½ cup
- Heavy cream - 2 cups
- Monk fruit/allulose - 5 tbsp [^1]
- Lemon juice - ½ tsp
- Vanilla extract - ½ tsp

## Instructions

1. Place a mixing bowl in the freezer, while you wash, hull and dice the strawberries. Add the strawberries to a mixing bowl, then pour the lemon juice and 1 tablespoon of monk fruit/allulose over the strawberries.
1. Toss to combine and let them sit at room temperature for 20 minutes or until the juices are drawn out of the strawberries.
1. Remove the bowl from the freezer and pour in the cold heavy cream. Whip using a hand mixer until you get soft peaks. Slowly pour in the remaining monk fruit/allose and vanilla extract as you continue whipping, until you get stiff peaks.
1. Slightly mash the strawberries. Pour half of them into a mini chopper and puree, making sure to leave some small chunks. Set the other half of the mashed strawberries aside for the topping.
1. Take half the whipped cream and add to another bowl. Fold the puréed strawberries into the whipped cream, leaving some streaks.
1. Take your serving glass and add a layer of the whipped cream. Add a layer of the strawberry whip cream mixture on top. Top with some of the reserved mashed strawberries and serve.

## Notes

[^1]:
    I highly recommend using monk fruit/allulose in this dessert, because it doesn't have a cooling effect.

    If you don't have the monk fruit/allulose blend on hand, you can use powdered monk fruit or Swerve confectioners as a 1:1 substitution.

    If you substitute with powdered allulose, use 7 tablespoons instead, since allulose isn't as sweet as monk fruit.
